# Scanning a “Local” Network
nmap -sn 192.168.66.0/24

# Scanning a “Remote” Network
nmap -sn 192.168.11.0/24

# List scan
nmap -sL 192.168.0.1/24

# Scanning TCP ports on host using connect scan (will complete TCP handshake)
nmap -sT 192.168.124.211

# Scanning TCP ports on host using stealth scan (will not complete TCP handshake)
nmap -sS 192.168.124.211

# Scanning UDP ports on host
nmap -sU 192.168.124.211

# Fast mode
-F which scans the 100 most common ports (instead of the default 1000).

# Range of ports
-p[range] allows you to specify a range of ports to scan. For example, -p10-1024 scans from port 10 to port 1024, while -p-25 will scan all the ports between 1 and 25.

# OS detection
-O

# Service and Version Detection
-sV

# Combination
What if you can have both -O, -sV and some more in one option? That would be -A. This option enables OS detection, version scanning, and traceroute, among other things.

# Force scan hosts
-Pn

# Speed
-T0 (paranoid)
-T1 (sneaky)
-T2 (polite)
-T3 (normal)
-T4 (aggressive)

# Verbosity
